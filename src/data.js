    info: "Across the vast expanse of the universe, life could only be found on one planet: Earth. The Life Spark. From that small spark, the fire of life blazed from planet to planet over millennia, as human beings travelled through space, colonising foreign planets and transforming these new worlds into their own. The New-world Humans evolved both in form and nature, resembling the humanity they originated from less and less. One people known as the Grift, whose transformation had been most acute, envied the true form that the Old-world Humans possessed. The Grift's rage towards all who resembled any original human likeness resulted in the Great War â€“ a battle for Earth, one which devastated the planet and annihilated nearly all those involved in the conflict.",
